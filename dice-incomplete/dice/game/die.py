        #Abstraction is defined as the process of turning a complex thing or idea into a simple thing or idea.Â  We use abstraction every day because it helps us break things down into understandable pieces. For example, if we use a built-in function to count the sum of a list we do not have to have as much knowledge as we would need to write a loop to accomplish the same result. That is where the main benefit of abstraction is. With abstraction we only need a surface level understand to utilize something more complex.
